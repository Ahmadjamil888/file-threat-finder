# File Threat Detection System

![Threat Detection Demo](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=File+Threat+Detection+Screenshot)

A web-based application that detects potential threats in files by analyzing file extensions, size, and content patterns.

## Features

- **File Type Analysis**: Detects dangerous file extensions (e.g., .exe, .bat, .js)
- **Content Scanning**: Identifies suspicious patterns in file content
- **Size Checking**: Flags large files (>10MB) that might cause denial of service
- **Real-time Results**: Immediate threat assessment with visual indicators
- **Client-side Processing**: All analysis happens in the browser (no file uploads)

## Detected Threat Patterns

- Executable files (.exe, .bat, .sh, etc.)
- Script files with suspicious patterns (.js, .php, .py)
- Files containing:
  - Base64 encoded strings
  - Potential shell commands
  - SQL injection patterns
  - XSS attack vectors
- Oversized files (>10MB)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Bootstrap 5
- File API (for client-side file processing)

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application**:
   - Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser

2. **Select a File**:
   - Click "Choose File" and select the file you want to analyze

3. **Scan the File**:
   - Click the "Scan File" button to begin analysis

4. **View Results**:
   - The system will display threat detection results including:
     - File information
     - Threat level (Safe, Warning, or Dangerous)
     - Specific threats detected
     - Suspicious patterns found

## Limitations

- Client-side only (no server-side analysis)
- Limited to detecting known patterns (not heuristic analysis)
- Text file analysis only (no deep binary analysis)
- Maximum file size limited by browser memory

## Future Enhancements

- Add malware signature detection
- Implement file hash checking against threat databases
- Add support for compressed file analysis (ZIP, RAR)
- Include more sophisticated pattern detection
- Add historical scan results tracking

## Installation

No installation required! This is a standalone HTML application.

1. Download the `index.html` file
2. Open it in any modern web browser
3. Start scanning files

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Safari (latest)

*Note: Internet Explorer is not supported.*
